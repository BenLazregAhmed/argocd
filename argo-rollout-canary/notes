Canary deployment :
ways to use canary deployment :
 Rolling Update :
 -Max surge: the maximum number of pods that can be created above the desired number replicas during the update .
             example : 5 replicas , max surge = 2 => max number of pods at any given time during update= 7
 -Max Unavailable: the maximum number of pods that can be subtracted from the desired number replicas during the update .
                   example : 5 replicas , max unavailable = 2 => min number of pods at any given time during update= 3
 Set Weight :
 - if we have 5 replicas for example and we set setWeight=30% ==> 30% of 5 = 1.5 so argo rollouts rounds the number up
 so we have 2 replicas of new version . 100% -30% = 70% , 70% of 5 = 3.5 argo rollouts rounds up this number also==>
 so we have 4 replicas of old version
